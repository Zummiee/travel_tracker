A travel tracker that allows users to track the countries that they have visited.

Main functions:
1. each user is linked to a color chosen at the time when the user account was created; to add a new country, simply input the country name in the input field (case does not matter) and click on the "Add" button, the country then will be highligted in the corresponding user color in the map.
2. to add a new user, simply click on the "Add New Member" button, this will redirect you to a page where you can add the name and color for the new account, once you have finished the configuration, click on "ADD", and the site will redirect you back to the home page.
3. to log visisted countries for a given user, you would first need to click on the user name on the home page.
4. the site also keeps track of the total number of countries added by a given user and shows the number at the bottom of the page.
5. to edit user data for a given user, first click on the name of the user whose data you would like to modify, then click on the "EDIT USER" button, this will redirect you to a page where you can add a new name and color for the chosen user, once you have finished the configuration, click on "CHANGE", and the site will redirect you back to the home page(changes just made will be reflected).
6. to delete a given user, simply click on the name of the user whom you would like to delete, then click on the "DELETE USER" button, and the site will redirect you back to the home page(change just made will be reflected). Note that "DELETE USER" button is not enabled for user with id 2.

Note: Frontend adapated based on codes provided in a course project, created backend independently.

TO DO:
1. error-handling when user chooses a used name while modifying user data.
2. add a function allowing users to unmark a country from the map in case of accidental addition.
3. update the list of available user colors.
