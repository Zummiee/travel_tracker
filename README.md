A travel tracker that allows users to track the countries that they and their family members have visited.

Main functions:
1. each user is linked to a color chosen at the time when the user account was created; to add a new country, simply input the country name in the input field (case does not matter) and click on the "Add" button, the country then will be highligted in the corresponding user color in the map.
2. to add a new user, simply click on the "Add Family Member" button, this will redirect you to a page where you can choose the name and color for the new account, once you have finished the configuration, click on "ADD", and the site will redirect you back to the home page.
3. to log visisted countries for a given user, you would first need to click on the user name on the home page.
4. the site also keeps track of the total number of countries added by a given user and shows the number at the bottom of the page.

TO DO:
1. add an "edit" function that allows users to change their name or color.
2. add a function allowing users to unmark a country from the map in case of accidental addition.
